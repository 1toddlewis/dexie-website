# Terms of Our Server Software License

The **Dexie Cloud Server software** includes binaries, source code, and documentation necessary to deploy Dexie Cloud on your own infrastructure.

## Purpose of Our Software License

Our software license aims:

- To grant you complete control over your infrastructure, including locations, cloud providers, hardware, etc.
- To prevent vendor lock-in and promote freedom in customizing the software to suit your application's needs.
- To enable modification of the source code for tailored adjustments to your application.
- To support an unlimited number of end users for your application without additional charges.
- To empower you to serve your application independently, without constraints on your business model when using Dexie Cloud for data storage and synchronization.

However, certain limitations still apply under this license, as detailed below.

### <i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Restrictions on Competition

This license prohibits the copying, selling, or other forms of redistributing the source code or binaries to other companies. While the software can be used to serve your application globally without extra costs, you are not permitted to distribute or sell the Dexie Cloud Server software itself. A purchased Dexie Cloud Server license is exclusively for internal use by the purchasing company, functioning as a storage platform for company-owned application(s).

*Note: This restriction pertains to Dexie Cloud Server (private source), not Dexie.js (open source, Apache 2.0 licensed).*

If you are interested in offering Dexie Cloud as service for external companies (like we do), please [contact us](mailto:business@dexie.org) so we can find a fair deal for that.
