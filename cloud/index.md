## Start Coding Your App Today

Start creating your awesome offline-first app **today**. While waiting for Dexie Cloud, use plain Dexie.js to create the model and the app. When Dexie Cloud is relased you can just hook it on to it!

To prepare your app for Dexie Cloud:

1. Install the [dexie-observable](/docs/Observable/Dexie.Observable) addon (to support the '[$$](http://localhost:4000/docs/Observable/Dexie.Observable#uuid-key-generator)' syntax) as a temp substitute for dexie-cloud-addon.
2. Declare the new [access control](docs/access-control) tables in your new db version.

You will have an app ready for the the cloud once Dexie Cloud is released.

When launching your app, our extremely simple [pricing](/cloud/pricing) makes it risk free to grow both small and big.
