## Start coding your app today

You can start creating your awesome app based on Dexie Cloud **today** - before it's even available in beta. Code your app with plain Dexie.js while waiting for Dexie Cloud to be released. It won't sync (yet), but since Dexie Cloud works with the same Dexie API that's already available, all app logic can be coded in advance, and let the multi-user experience with sync, access control and realtime collaboration features start working as soon as Dexie Cloud is available for you.

To prepare your app for Dexie Cloud:

1. Install the [dexie-observable](/docs/Observable/Dexie.Observable) addon (to support the '[$$](http://localhost:4000/docs/Observable/Dexie.Observable#uuid-key-generator)' syntax) as a temp substitute for dexie-cloud-addon.
2. Declare the new [access control](docs/access-control) tables in your new db version and use them to support
   shared objects in teams or between users.

You will be able to code and locally test your application, taking advantage of the features in Dexie Cloud once it is released.

When launching your app, our extremely simple [pricing](/cloud/pricing) makes it risk free to grow both small and big.
