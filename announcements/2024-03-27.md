Dear Developers and App-Creators!

<img class="headshot" style="width: 400px; height: auto; float:right;" src="/assets/images/david-linkedin.jpeg" />
I am thrilled to announce that Dexie Cloud is now finally in official production, after three years of dedication, hard work, and perseverance. This journey has been nothing short of extraordinary, characterized by countless late nights, technological breakthroughs, and the unwavering support of our invaluable beta users.

For me, this isn't just about creating another product; it's about offering something that makes it easier and more enjoyable to build apps that truly work in everyday life.

Dexie Cloud is the culmination of my passion for technology and programming. I wanted to create a tool that not only streamlines the programming process but also provides a delightful user experience. With Dexie Cloud, you get a comprehensive solution for data storage and synchronization, meaning you can create apps that run smoothly and reliably, even when there's no stable network connection. I hereby invite you to experience what I believe is the future of app development.

Let's innovate, create, and thrive with Dexie Cloud!

David Fahlander, Author of Dexie.js
