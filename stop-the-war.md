title: Stop Putin Stop!
---

Hi, I'm David, the author of Dexie.js and I'm from Sweden. I hereby take a stand against Putin's illegal and horrible war under **false flag** against his **brother country Ukraine**!

The world is watching.

**[Russia falsely blames Ukraine for starting war](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-russia-falsely-blames-ukraine-for-starting-war/a-60999948)**

In United Nations, 141 member states voted for a [resolution deploring Russia's invasion of Ukraine](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1113152). Only 5 member states voted against.

The world is watching!

What can you do to stop it?
