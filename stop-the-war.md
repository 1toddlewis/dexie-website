title: Stop Putin!
---

Hi, I'm David, the author of Dexie.js and I'm from Sweden. I hereby take a stand against Putin's illegal and horrible war under **false flag** against his **brother country Ukraine**!

The world is watching.

In United Nations, 141 member states voted for a [resolution deploring Russia's invasion of Ukraine](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1113152). Only 5 member states voted against.

**[Fact check: Russia falsely blames Ukraine for starting war](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-russia-falsely-blames-ukraine-for-starting-war/a-60999948)**

The world is watching!

What can you do to stop it?

# For Russia but against Putin!

Never blame the Russian people. Instead, show Russians that you love Russia but are against Putin's illegal war and awful lies to the all and especially his lies to the Russian people.


Go dining on Russian Restaurants! Write in their guest book:

    The food was great! Unfortunately, Putin spoiled our appetites by invading Ukraine.

And to the Russian people, **please spread the true facts to relatives and friends!**

# Fact checks on Putin's propaganda

# Open Source is about freedom, democracy and peacefulness

We want to live in a world where people are free. Open source community incarnates that spirit. The spritit of democracy, freedom and peacefulness. The opposite of all this is authoritarianism. An attack on a democratic country under false flag is an attack of all of us who want's to live in a free spirit. This is a battle between good and evil. Between openess and closeness. Between democracy and authoritarianism. Between peace and war.

In the end, freedom, goodness and democracy will win.
