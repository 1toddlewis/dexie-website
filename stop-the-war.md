Hi, I'm David, the author of Dexie.js and I'm from Sweden. I hereby take a stand against Putin's illegal and horrible war under **false flag** against his **brother country Ukraine**!

The world is watching.

In United Nations, 141 member states voted for a [resolution deploring Russia's invasion of Ukraine](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1113152). Only 5 member states voted against.

The world is watching!

What can you do to stop it?

# Fact checks against Putin's propaganda

# Open Source is about freedom, democracy and peacfulness

We want to live in a world where people are free. Open source community incarnates that spirit. The spritit of democracy, freedom and peacefulness. The opposite of all this is authoritarianism. An attack on a democratic country under false flag is an attack of all of us who want's to live in a free spirit. This is a battle between good and evil. Between openess and closeness. Between democracy and authoritarianism. Between peace and war.

In the end, freedom, goodness and democracy will win.
